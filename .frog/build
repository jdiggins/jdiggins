It takes markdown files, turns them into blog posts, and renders a nice static webpage that I can easily push to github. It is easy to modify the site as needed, but comes out of the box doing its job extremely well.</p>\n\n<p>I have tried creating blogs in the past, the most recent being one I wrote using Django, but they seemed to have too much overhead and didn&rsquo;t allow easy control over formatting my posts.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-not-use-wordpress-or-blogger\">Why not use Wordpress or Blogger?</h2>\n\n<p>It is easier for me to open up my terminal, type <code>raco frog -n blog-title</code>, and write some markdown, than to have to log into a Blogger account or navigate to some site to create a post. I think the real reason is the hacker in me would rather just do it myself.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-i-plan-for-the-future-with-frog\">What I plan for the future with Frog</h2>\n\n<p>I hope to write occational posts with updates on what I am working on, how-to&rsquo;s for anything programming related that I don&rsquo;t want to forget, as well as posts related to guitar and P4 tuning. I plan on adding some sort of tool to Frog that allows me to easily write and display guitar tab and/or music notation directly in my blog posts.</p>"))))
